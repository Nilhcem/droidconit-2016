(this will be BEFORE you reach the terraces of La Posteria and Shakespeare). once you go through the doors you will be in a small lobby; Impact Hub is the office on your left.<br /><br /><b>from Dubai mall</b>: <a href="https://vimeo.com/94134457">click here for a nifty walkthrough video</a> you\'d exit from The Works+Garrett\'s/Social Wok doors in the lower Basement level, traverse the tourist-gauntlet Bridge of fate, and enter Souk Al Bahar\'s pedestrian entrance. keep walking until you see Bateel and Rifai on your right, then go left in the main corridor until you see Spinney\'s on your left. Take the escalators up to the Caribou/Starbucks floor, and exit into the Parking Lot past the ATM. follow the driveway to the right, pass several cars, and on the right you will see the other entrance marked Core B (NOT D or E). that\'s it, you\'re home!<br /><br />lost? just ask a security guard where SAAHA OFFICES B are. still lost? call  04 3754444. still lost? go sip green tea.]]></string>
