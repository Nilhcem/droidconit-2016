I like Open Source projects. I’m a big fan of a lot of fancy Android libraries out there and I contribute with bug reporting, fixing and feedback.\nI approached Reactive Programming in 2013 and I started using it in Android thanks to RxJava by Netflix. I’m using it in every Android app I work on since then, because RxJava solves so many issues on Android and it gives you a new perspective about mobile programming.\nIn 2015, I published RxJava Essentials for Packt Publishing. I'm releasing Learning Embedded Android Programming for Packt Publishing and I’m currently writing Grokking Rx for Manning Publishing.",
