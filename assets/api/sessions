  "title": "#PERFMATTERS for Android",
  "description": "The slogan ‘#PERFMATTERS’ by Colt McAnlis is one of the most important statements, which an Android developer should follow. A well performing application makes the difference between a nice looking application and one, which gets successful. You, as an Android developer, have the responsibility to delight your users, so they don’t feel how much work your application has to burden to fulfill the user’s needs. This session will show you some easy optimizations and how to avoid glitches in the application. A lot of developers would shout, that this is premature optimization. In contrary it is preventive. With a small amount of work while developing you can avoid a lot of pitfalls. You will hopefully have a better understanding of the underlying system afterwards. During the session some tools and frameworks will be presented for helping you to fulfill your mission."

  "description": "An agile software development was introduced to focus more on individuals, interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change. An agile team usually consists of 4 to 6 members including product owner, testers, designers, developers and agile coach. It is straightforward for smaller companies to apply. As a company grows, you might wonder how to keep the agile. Spotify has mainly formed agile teams based on features. However, teams’ autonomous could be restricted by an application architecture. We’ve changed an application architecture to support a scaled agile. Several ideas are borrowed from a longest time used architecture, WWW(world wide web). In this talk, we describe our application architecture with lessons."

This will further enhance the experience of developing Android applications with Android Studio way beyond better performance. In this presentation, we will take a closer look at those Gradle enhancements and how they manifest in the context of Android and Android Studio. We will also demonstrate some new tooling that is going to be very beneficial to understand and improve your Android builds."

We may learn from others and also make our own apps more secure.\nWe can pinpoint bugs that come from closed-source libraries such as those for ad and tracking networks, and work around those bugs, get them fixed faster, or even patch them if need be!\nThis talk will present simple real-world examples for maximum practical benefit using some of the ever improving set of reverse engineering tools for Android.\nYou don’t need to have any experience reverse engineering anything before, but hopefully even if you do you’ll pick up a few useful tips.\nThis talk aims to make every developer more familiar with the reverse engineering tools available for Android, and how and why they should apply them.\nThere’s an incredible amount that can be learned from taking things apart!"

  "description": "We know one of the main characteristics of Java is portability, and that usually means it is not as efficient as it should be. That might be the reason Java has never been associated with high performance, but nowadays there are a lot of Java powered devices in the world and lots of people are building applications for them.\n\nCompilers that produce native machine code do a great optimisation job because they know where the code is going to be executed. But because of the portability feature, the Java Compiler could not assume anything about where our program is going to run and leaves all the optimisations to be done by the JVM while loading or, even, running our code (or converting it to native code in the case of ART)\n\nIn this session you will not only learn how to make your Android code faster but also what to avoid when looking for critical performance and a bigger understanding of how the Java compiler works, and how these small changes affect to Dalvik VM and the ART runtime."

The answer of those who know, and like 90s music, is most likely “baby don’t hurt me, don’t hurt me, no more”.\nIt is often said that text is the most difficult part of a graphics toolkit and that is for good reasons.\nIn this talk we’re going to give you the tools you need to understand text, and bend this mysterious creature to your will.\nFrom the typography theory behind the fonts system, to the intricacies of supporting Unicode bidirectional text runs, to the typesetting itself, that would be enough to drive someone crazy. And there’s still nothing being drawn on screen, with that alone!\nNext you’ll need to have a text rendering engine that takes care of loading the fonts, laying out the glyphs, taking care of hinting too, and then actually draw them somewhere (let alone doing all this in a performant way).\nStill here? Good, then prepare for a journey that will take you through the history, implementation and pain of dealing with text.\nBehold the amazing powers you’ll acquire, enabling you to tame all kinds of text you’ll see on Android."

However, it’s still used in a big amount of projects.\nDuring this presentation Mateusz will show you how he shot his foot multiple times by using eventbus not wisely. He’ll tell you about the alternatives for different usecases (not only RxJava-based) and scenarios where buses still work well enough."
